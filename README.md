A simple aviation weather app for iOS

### Project status
**Currently on a feature freeze while I build and run XCode tests.** Targeting late February or early March to continue adding features.

### Eye candy, anyone?
Check out the **screenshots** folder to see how it's coming along :)

### What's done?
- WeatherView is functional, but can add more.
- ListView is functional.

### What's next?
- FlightPlanView, allows users to look at origin, destination, and alternate weather in one screen.
- SettingsView, currently, most settings can be changed on taps on WeatherView or through iOS settings, want to have a dedicated one on app.
- MapView, tied to whether I decide to start using AWC's cached 5-minute data, and then we'll take it from there.
